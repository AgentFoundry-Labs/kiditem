# automation — Workflows, Alerts, Action Board, Panel

`src/automation/` owns workflow templates/runs, alert lifecycle, action-board
tasks, marketplace install orchestration, and Live Ops panel projection. It is
not the owner for downstream business mutations; business domains expose events
or ports that automation can consume.

## Owned Surfaces

- Workflows and workflow runs: `/api/workflows/*`, `/api/workflow-runs/*`
- Alerts and operation alerts: `/api/alerts/*`, `/api/operation-alerts/*`
- Action board tasks: `/api/action-tasks/*`
- Marketplace installs: `/api/marketplace/*`
- Live Ops panel stream/snapshot/backfill: `/api/panel/*`

## Main Data Models

- `WorkflowTemplate` defines trusted workflow DAGs.
- `WorkflowRun` stores run audit state and steps.
- `Alert` is the user-facing signal store.
- `ActionTask` is personal work promoted from alerts.
- `OperationAlert` tracks durable long-running operation lifecycle keyed by
  `(organizationId, operationKey)`.

## Workflow Flow

```text
POST /api/workflows/:id/run
  -> WorkflowOrchestrationService.triggerRun
  -> create WorkflowRun(pending)
  -> WorkflowRunnerService.runWorkflow(...)
  -> execute slim-core DAG nodes
  -> record steps + terminal status
  -> emit panel upsert
```

AI work inside workflows delegates through `agent_task.create` and Agent OS.
Workflow nodes do not call LLM/provider SDKs directly.

## Cross-Domain Ports

- Automation publishes `OPERATION_ALERT_PORT` for cross-owner producers.
- Producer domains own local consumer-side operation-alert ports and bind them
  through `adapter/out/automation/operation-alert.adapter.ts`.
- `ActionBoardService`, `PanelSseService`, and
  `WorkflowOrchestrationService` remain transitional class exports until
  consumers move to owner-side ports.

## Boundary Rules

- Application services depend on `application/port/out/*` tokens, not concrete
  adapters.
- `application/port/**` contracts expose local structural records, not Prisma
  model/input types.
- Panel code is a read-only projection and must not mutate owner-domain rows.
- Marketplace install validates allowed workflow nodes through the slim-core
  allowlist before writing templates.
- Client/template JSON never supplies trusted `organizationId`,
  `_workflow_run_id`, or `_workflow_node_id`; the runner re-binds trusted scope.

## Transitional Exceptions

- `WorkflowRunnerService` still imports the executor registry and passes
  `PrismaService` to executor framework code.
- `adapter/out/panel-event/**`, `adapter/out/workflow-runner/**`, and
  `mapper/panel-event/**` are documented Prisma/projection carve-outs.
- More-specific adapter rules live in
  `adapter/out/panel-event/AGENTS.md` and
  `adapter/out/workflow-runner/AGENTS.md`.
